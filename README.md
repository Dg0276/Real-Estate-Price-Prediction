# Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts real estate prices based on various property features. The model uses **Linear Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm, to estimate house prices. The goal is to predict the price of a property using features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict real estate prices. The dataset includes features such as:
- Square footage of the property
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Property location (neighborhood or zip code)
- Age of the property

The code preprocesses the data, trains the Linear Regression model, evaluates its performance, and predicts prices for new data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data/` directory. It contains columns representing various property features such as:

- `square_feet`: Size of the property in square feet
- `num_bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `num_bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `location`: The neighborhood or area where the property is located
- `price`: The target variable - the price of the property

You can upload your own dataset or use the provided sample `housing_data.csv`.

### Additional Notes

- Consider experimenting with more advanced models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.
- Feature scaling might be useful depending on the dataset. Try normalizing or standardizing the features for better performance.
- If your dataset has missing values, you can try imputation techniques or remove rows/columns with missing data.
